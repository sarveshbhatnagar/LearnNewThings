# LearnNewThings
Collection of course materials used to learn something new

## Natural Language Processing with deep learning
Currently I am doing this course from youtube : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6 , 
Its fun so far...

## Artificial Intelligence
Its my favourite course taught by Prof. Patrick Winston. His teaching style is just amazing, and the course content was easy to digest.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are the core for any computer science student. If anyone is interested in learning algorithmic thinking, this course is definately recommended.

### Deliberate Practice

I stumbled across a youtube video talking about deliberate practice, thought it might be useful to know about it and read a paper on it.

## Books Read

### Zero to one - Peter Thiel, Blake Masters(currently reading)
My objective in reading this book was to understand the author's perspective, understand what are his underlying principles and according to him what defines the base foundation for building a successful startup. This book is beyond expectations, it analyzes the reasons for the success and failures of various startups, although sometimes he is visibly partial in some cases, overall this book provides an in-depth understanding of how one should approach in building a successful startup. Also, the message of "creating new from zero to one" instead of usually accepted, "scaling an already established market" is what I like the most. Also the message, "entering a market with little to no competition and owning a fair share of it, instead of entering an already competitive market" is what I found quite analogous with my view. In all, creating something new, useful, is something one should focus on. 

### Thinking fast and slow - Daniel Kahneman
Its a nice book about how we think talks about two different types of systems in our brain, one which calculates and evaluates options and others which reacts first... Its been a while since I read this book, I guess I did when I was in 11th grade at that point in my life I was dull and uninterested in doing things, but I still loved to read about our mind and I am still intrigued by how our brain works... It's a nice book and I recommend it to anyone interested in understanding our brain a bit more. An example from the book which I still remember is something like this, "When asked people to guess how old a particular person is, and before that hinting to a larger number or smaller number, changes the average outcome..." e.g. If I said that My friend's grandfathers age is 2000 yo, and then I ask you to estimate his age, your response would be on the higher end... A trick used by many salespeople.

### Society of mind - Marvin Minsky
Society of mind is just amazing, It explains the working of different parts of the brain in a friendly and comprehensible manner, despite the inundation with details it is easy to understand and digest. You can find a complete course on this book on youtube, the links are mentioned above...(courses I have done section). That aside, this book converts the complex processes in our brain to a set of basic processes working together as a society with a lot of additional details included. Just grab the book and start reading, I bet you will like it given that you like to read about how our brain possibly works...

### The art of war  - Sun Tzu
A little is known about the author, the author is one of the legends... He talks about tactics in wars, war is not the topic I am interested about (although I am a little bit, my favorite games are all war games... AOE, Rise of nations, etc.), my main focus in reading this book was for understanding tactics, these tactics should be at one's hand for him to employ them whenever needed. I would like to state an example from the current book which I am reading and the art of war... In the art of war, Sun Tzu says, "Avoid war if its a prolonged one, only pick battles which you can swiftly complete..." This particular statement is in a way used in the book "Zero to one", the author says, "sometimes you do have to fight. Where that's true you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don't throw any punches or strike hard and end it quickly."

### Adventures of tom swayer - Mark Twain
It is the first "real" book I read. I had to mention it, it has an emotional value attached to it. Mark Twain used to be my favorite author and in this book its a nice carefree kid's story namely Tom Swayer with his friend Huckleberry Fin an orphan.
